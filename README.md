                                                         **______Traffic Light Controller (Verilog)______**
Designed and simulated a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog, focusing on state transitions and timing management. Developed real-time logic for an efficient traffic control system, utilizing Xilinx Vivado for simulation. Applied state machines and timing logic to create a robust solution for real-world traffic management.
